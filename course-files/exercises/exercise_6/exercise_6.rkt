; a direction is one of...
; - 'up
; - 'down
; - 'left

; If this type looks new to you, its just a symbol.
; That is ‘up is a symbol and “up” is a string.
; Symbols are like strings without spaces.

; That is, segments is a non-empty list of posns. 
; x-coordinates increase from 1 to board-length (inclusive) toward the right
; y-coordinates increase from 1 to board-length (inclusive) toward the top
; the default value for board-length is 50.

; food is either
; - empty

; That is, food is a list of posns.

; Obstacles is also a list of posns.
