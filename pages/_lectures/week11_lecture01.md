    title: "Debugging and Testing"
---

Today we'll be focusing on reviewing our "soft-skills." We've talked a lot about debugging and testing throughout the quarter, but we've really undersold the importance of these two "soft-skills" when it comes to real software development. We'll talk about both of these topics today both with an eye to the past as well as a look toward the future in your other CS classes and contexts.
