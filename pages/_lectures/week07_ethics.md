The idea behind this session is to explore how technology affects individuals, communities, and societies, including topics such as digital divides, the impacts of automation on employment, and the potential consequences of emerging technologies such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence. This module will also explore ethical considerations related to technology deployment and use, such as responsible innovation and the importance of considering the identities of those using a technology before deployment.

## Part 1 - Complete the Pre-Discussion Activity

Everyone is required to complete this pre-discussion activity. Please watch the first episode of Season 3 of the Netflix show _Black Mirror_ which is entitled **Nosedive**. (Please see below for access notes.)

 While you are watching, consider the following questions:

* Are there other forms of media that you've consumed that deal with similar themes to this episode?
* Can you think of example rating systems in use in the world right now?
* What does your social media presence reveal about you?

> **Optional Follow-up**: Like this episode? Checkout S06E01 (_Joan is Awful_) and consider the following:
> * How does the episode explore the emotional impact on Joan and her relationships as a result of this intrusion into her private life?
> * The episode portrays the mediaâ€™s manipulation of people's lives for profit. How does this portrayal reflect contemporary concerns about data privacy and the impact on people?
> * Reflecting on the episode, what commentary do you think it is making about the intersection of media, privacy, and individual autonomy? How does it prompt us to reevaluate our relationship with media and the importance of personal boundaries in an increasingly connected world?

## Part 3 - Submit your Self Reflection

After attending your discussion section, be sure to return here to complete this self-reflection. Reflect on your discussion section (200-300 words): What stood out most to you? What did you learn?

Feel free to also comment on how your discussion went and if anything surprised you.
