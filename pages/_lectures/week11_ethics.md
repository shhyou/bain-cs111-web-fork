Either individually or in a group of **AT MOST** 4 people, choose at least 2 questions from the following options and write a short response (200+ words for individuals or 400+ words for groups) for each one, reflecting on the discussions you attended throughout the quarter:

1. What does ethics mean to you outside our class? What led you to this conclusion, and what are some other ways people might define ethics?
2. How has your understanding of the societal, ethical, and political impacts of technology changed over the course of this class (if at all)?
3. What ethical challenges do you anticipate encountering in your pursuit of computer science and what do you think could help you overcome them?
4. What other ethics topics do you think might be interesting for future iterations of this class (make sure to provide a specific real world example that demonstrates your ideas relevance)?
5. While we can all reason about broad technology-related ethical issues, do you think your understanding of ethics specifically in computer science might change as you take more courses and learn more about the discipline?

* * *

## If you choose to submit in a group

Group members should all have attended different discussions and each topic should be represented in the reflection:
* Indicate clearly who wrote each part of the reflection.
* Make sure the response as a whole is cohesive and each member's response connects to others'.
* We encourage you to talk about your experiences attending different discussions and how it influenced your responses.
* Make sure to write everyone's names at the top of the document <mark>AND everyone should upload the document separately</mark>

<mark>If you do not follow these instructions and the same submission is received for more than one student, all of those students will receive a **0**.</mark>
