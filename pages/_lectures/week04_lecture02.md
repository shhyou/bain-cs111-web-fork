Now that we have ways of expressing the real world in composite data structures, we need to learn how to manipulate those structures.

In the pre-recorded lectures for today we learn about a number of usual functions that apply to composite data structures. Then, in-class, we'll put them into action on some real data in Tutorial 2.
