Today we'll focus on introducing our final context of the quarter: the game Asteroids! In today's pre-recorded lecture videos, we'll explore the setup of the `asteroids_lib` which we'll give to you as part of the Tutorial and Exercise this week.

Then, it will be your job, across these two assignments, to use that library to implement a functioning version of asteroids.
