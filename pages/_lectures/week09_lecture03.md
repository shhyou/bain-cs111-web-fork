Today we'll spend most of our time reviewing for Quiz 3 by doing some practice questions. In addition to Practice Quiz 3, don't forget there's also Practice Quizzes 1 and 2, and your REAL Quiz 1 & 2, and Exercise 7 all as ways of getting prepared.

## Topics

While there will be content from Q1 and Q2 on Quiz 3, the focus of the quiz will be on Lectures 17 - 22. There's a number of big topics that are especially important:

1. Imperatives
2. Scope
3. Subtyping
4. Methods

All of the code on Quiz 3 will be in the Advanced Student Language. Remember, **imperatives totally change the way our programs work** because now we have the option of having functions that **either have no input or no output (or both)**.

Additionally, we now need to both remember that most variables (ones that are mutable) can be updated...and that if we want to update them we must do it ourselves using `set!`.
