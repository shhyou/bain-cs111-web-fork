Today we'll build off the pre-recorded lecture on Data Flow diagrams to start designing programs using a text-based programming language. Make sure to watch the lecture video BEFORE coming to class.

If you are having trouble accessing the above videos, please try the following:

1. Open up our Canvas page.
2. On the list of things on the left, click on Panopto
3. It may ask you to open it up in a separate window.

You'll then see a Folder where you can access the Lecture Videos and the above links will now magically work! <mark>To access the video with Mini-Quiz 0 built-in, you'll need to click the LOAD button at the bottom of this Canvas page.</mark>

Also in-class, we'll... 

* Do our first in-person Mini-Quiz (Mini-Quiz 1) via PollEverywhere!
* Complete most of Exericse 0. If you'd like, you can go ahead and complete it before you come to class. <mark>I highly recommend doing at least the download step before coming to class as the internet in the auditorium slows WAYYYYYY down when 250 people are in there.</mark>
