Today we'll build off the pre-recorded lecture on Data Flow diagrams to start designing programs using a text-based programming language. Make sure to watch the lecture video BEFORE coming to class.

If you are having trouble accessing the above videos, please try the following:

1. Open up our Canvas page.
2. On the list of things on the left, click on Panopto
3. It may ask you to open it up in a separate window.

You'll then see a Folder where you can access the Lecture Videos and the above links will now magically work!

Also in-class, we'll complete most of Exericse 0. If you'd like, you can go ahead and complete it before you come to class.
