> **Reminder**...starting with Module 2, only students registered for this module need to complete all 3 parts of these assignments. If you are
> interested in the topic, you should feel free to complete Part 1, but Part 2 and Part 3 are reserved for those registered for that
> particular module.

In this session, we'll study the importance of making technology accessible and usable for people with disabilities or those with limited resources, as well as the ways in which technology can create or widen existing digital divides. Topics in this module will include universal design principles, accessibility standards and regulations, and the role of technology companies in promoting accessibility.

## Part 1 - Complete the Pre-Dicussion Activity

Everyone is required to complete this pre-discussion activity. Please watch (or listen) to to Judy Brewer's (_Turing Award_ Winner and former WAI Director of the W3C) TEDxMIT talk on _Creating an Accessible Digital Future_.

As you watch, consider the tools you use everyday. Are all accessible to those with visual, auditory, or mobility impairments? What about those with cognitive impairments? Could these tools be redeisgned to be moved towards being universally accessible?
