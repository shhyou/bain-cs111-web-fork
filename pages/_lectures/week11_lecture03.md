Today we're wrapping up! We've made it to the end. Though it is a Friday, there won't be a MQ today.

[PM/TA Appreciation Notes](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddiGS8vaFHT1KTf2fat_zQrSv0fMd2Gzw_TwPTcebjLiZLKg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
If someone on the course staff helped you this quarter, take a second to say thanks!

We'll do a run through of an example that covers literally all of the content in the course.

I like to save the last bit of the last class for a more "general" Q&A. Have a question about CS, NU, industry, academia, the class, the department, etc.? Submit here and I'll answer some at the end of class today. The form is anonymous but please don't post questions that aren't fit for public consumption. They'll be screened before class.
