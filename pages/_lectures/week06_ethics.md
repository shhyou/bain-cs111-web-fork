The intersection of identity and technology is complex and multidimensional and requires close examination. Technology has the power to shape, assume, and assimilate identity in ways that have significant social and cultural impact. Conversely, identity plays a vital role in shaping our interactions with technology; influencing the design, adoption, and use of technological tools and platforms. Through an exploration of contemporary events through stakeholder analysis, this discussion section aims to deepen students' understanding of the relationship between identity and technology.

Drawing on case studies and personal experiences, students will critically reflect on how technology both reflects and reinforces existing social norms and power structures, as well as how it can challenge and transform them. Particular attention will be paid to issues of equity, inclusion, and social justice, as students consider the ways in which technology can perpetuate or disrupt systems of oppression and marginalization. Ultimately, this discussion seeks to equip students with the analytical tools needed to navigate the complex terrain of identity and technology. By fostering a critical awareness of the ways in which technology and identity interact, students will be better positioned to engage with the social and cultural implications of technological innovation and to contribute to the creation of a more just and equitable digital world.

## Part 1 - Complete the Pre-Discussion Activity

Everyone is required to complete this pre-discussion activity. Please read the article linked at the bottom of the page that chronicles one team's journey to create a _privacy preserving data collection tool_ written by Eileen Guo and Tate Ryan-Mosley for the _MIT Technology Review_. While you are reading, consider the following questions:

* Have you encountered situations where data about your activities was being recorded without explicit consent?
* How does data collection being "anonymous" affect your feelings about privacy?
* Sometimes well-intentioned ideas can have secondary effects that aren't clear until other stakeholder groups take interest. Can you think of other technologies that have been introduced in recent years that have initially been introduced to great acclaim only to later be implemented by entities with malintent?

## Part 2 - Attend your Discussion Section

You should have registered for a discussion section this week by joining the appropriate Canvas group. Switching sessions is not allowed and attendance at your registered section is required and you must be in-attendance _for the entirety of the session_. For questions about discussion sections please post on edSTEM or email Prof. Bain (<connor.bain@northwestern.edu>).

## Part 3 - Submit your Self Reflection

After attending your discussion section, be sure to return here to complete this self-reflection. Reflect on your discussion section (200-300 words): Think about yourself as a stakeholder in the case of the university mites. What are some unique values or concerns to consider? Are there any constraints or disadvantages of this method? Was there anything you particularly liked or disliked about the discussion, or any other feedback?
