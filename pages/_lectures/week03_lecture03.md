Today we'll add yet another tool to our ever-expanding toolbox: the **conditional expression**.

These expressions allow to ask "questions" in our programs and then do certain things if the answer is yes...or a totally different thing if the answer is no.

We'll spend the rest of our time completing Mini-Quiz 5 which will focus on the pre-recorded lecture content from Lecture 6.
