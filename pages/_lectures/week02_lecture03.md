Today we'll be mostly focused on talking about the new language (vocabulary) we've learned in the class so far.

As part of class, for those that are with us in-person, you'll complete **Mini-Quiz 3** in the form of questions on a service called Poll Everywhere.

It's recommended you sit in your Tutorial Groups, but not required.
