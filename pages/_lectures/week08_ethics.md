Technological developments have brought about significant changes in the nature of work; producing new forms of labor. On one hand, advances in automation, artificial intelligence, and other technologies have created new opportunities for high-skilled workers and entrepreneurs to develop innovative products and services. On the other hand, technology has also enabled the creation of new forms of low-wage and precarious work, often in the form of "gig economy" jobs that are highly flexible but lack the job security, benefits, and protections of traditional employment. One of the key features of these new forms of work is the platformization of labor, where companies such as Uber, Airbnb, and Fiverr act as intermediaries between workers and customers, taking a cut of the profits in exchange for providing access to customers and handling administrative tasks. This has created new opportunities for workers to earn income on their own terms, but it has also led to concerns about exploitation as workers are often classified as contractors rather than employees, which means they do not receive protections such as a minimum wage, overtime pay, or benefits.

In addition, certain types of emerging technologies require new forms of labor that are cognitively demanding, not evaluated for worker safety, and threaten to widen the existing digital divide. Workers in these industries often face long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions, as companies seek to maximize profits by outsourcing production to countries with weaker labor protections.

 While you are reading, consider the following questions:

- Have you or anyone you known taken part in the gig economy?
- What are some advantages of gig work for the workers?
- What are some advantages of gig work for the companies?
- Are these ever in conflict with one another?

## Part 3 - Submit your Self Reflection

After attending your discussion section, be sure to return here to complete this self-reflection. Reflect on your discussion section (200-300 words): Based on what you learned from the discussion, how do you think the concept of labor will change in the future? Was there anything you particularly liked or disliked about the discussion, or any other feedback?
