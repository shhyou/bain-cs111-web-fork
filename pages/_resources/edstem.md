You can join our edSTEM page (which we use for Q&As as well as post tips/tricks throughout the quarter) by signing up **using your offical Northwestern email address** [here](https://edstem.org/us/join/pFx2Ru).

## Some guidelines for using edSTEM
* Before you post a question, please do a quick search to make sure that one of your classmates hasn't already asked the same question
* edSTEM gives you the option of posting anonymously (to your classmates) so that you donâ€™t feel intimidated in asking your questions
* As a general rule, *do not post ANY code* that would be part of an answer to any question that has not already had its solutions released
* Please use edSTEM for assignment questions that would benefit the class as a whole. Any assignment questions emailed directly to any member of the course staff will be forwarded to edSTEM
* If you have a question about code that requires you to show someone your code, you may submit a private post (just to the course staff) with your code (That said, PM office hours are usually more efficient for these sorts of questions)

### Other Questions
For any other issues that you think are not appropriate for the peer mentors or graduate TA, please talk to Prof. Bain. This might include things like concerns about your progress in the course, questions about content from lectures, personal matters related to your participation in the course, larger grade concerns, advice about future courses, majors, and internships, etc.
