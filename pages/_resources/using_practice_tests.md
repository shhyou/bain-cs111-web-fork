Practice tests are often seen as a panacea for midterms and finals studying. While they're useful to practice _test taking skills_, they aren't representative of "studying" the underlying material.

## Advice
* When you take a practice test...**actually take it**.
  * Set aside the prescribed test time
  * Take it in a quiet place
  * Only use the materials you'll be allowed in the actual exam
  * Most importantly **do not look at the solutions until you written some answer down**
* Just because you solved a problem on a practice exam **does not** show that you know how to identify that _class_ of problem on an exam.
  * When you see a problem on a practice exam, try to brainstorm variations of problems you might see on the real exam.
  * Would you know how to solve the question if it were asked in a different way?
  * What if they included this variable, but not this other variable? Etc.
* If you get problems wrong, identify **why** you got them wrong.
  * What about the problem led you down the wrong solution?
  * What sort of strategy can you make to avoid that wrong path?
  * How might you remember this mistake next time you have a similar problem?
* While you can certainly ask Professors/TAs/PMs for advice on what extra material you might use to study _do not ask for extra practice exams_ to be released.
  * Not only is it a huge amount of work to design an even-handed exam...but taking practice exams is **NOT** the only way of studying for an exam
  * See if you can identify extra problems in the slides/lectures
  * Try to explain one of the topics covered on the exam to your roommate
  * Try to write your own questions based on the ones you see in the available practice exam
