# About the Course

This is an introductory course on the fundamentals of computer programming. This class is meant to allow students to explore many of the core concepts of computer science (CS) and serves as the first course in core sequence at Northwestern. It is specifically designed to be open to students of **all** backgrounds and does not expect **any** computer science knowledge or prior programming experience.

> Please note that if you are looking to learn a specific programming language (i.e. "learn how to code in Python"), please consider registering for [COMP_SCI 110](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/110.html) instead. While this course is certainly an introduction to programming, it is first and foremost an introduction to core CS concepts. We use programming as _a means to understand and implement these concepts_ rather than simply learning a single programming language. The ideas we talk about in this class apply to **all programming languages** and set the basis for you to be able to quickly pick up new programming languages throughout your future studies in CS.

This course uses the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) programming language and its associated Integrated Development Environment (IDE) [DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/) as its main programming tools.

The main goal in this course is _to learn how to **design** and **reason** about programs_.

The **reasoning** part matters because programs never work the first time. So you need to be able to figure what it's really doing and why, then change it to do what you want. Programmers are first and foremost detectives and diagnosticians. We're doctors trying to understand why our patients are sick.

The **design** part matters because the only way you'll be able to reason about it is if you design it in a way that makes it easy for humans to understand, whether said human is your future self trying to add a new feature, or someone else who's taken over the project and is now trying to understand your code.

Beyond this main goal, the course has a number of interwoven learning objectives. Students will work to understand:

* **Composition** (literally "placing together"): algorithms and data are built up by joining simple components into more complex ones.
* **Abstraction**: Complex arrangements can be reproduced and used as if they were simple components.
* **Metaprogramming**: Programs can be used to aid the process of programming itself.
* **Programmability and universality**: Computers are unique artifacts in that a single device can perform an infinite set of possible functions, including emulating other computers.
* _Programming as a **psychological** discipline_: Programming is more about the limits of human intelligence than about memorizing bits of code.
* _Programming as an **aesthetic** discipline_: Code can be beautiful; it can also be ugly.  Those distinctions have real consequences in the world.

Programming is a powerful medium for creative expression. It can be a representational medium, a tool for thinking about problems, a way of amplifying and/or communicating ideas, a means of performing complex calculations over massive datasets, and more. Being a computer scientist is *not* a prerequisite for creating useful or advanced programs. In fact, most people who write computer programs are not computer scientists, but rather people who occupy a range of professions. Journalists, geographers, sociologists, scientists, artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, researchers, etc., use programming languages to accomplish diverse and specialized goals. And as data and computing increasingly influence and perfuse modern life, understanding the mechanisms (and risks!) that underlie these systems is a valuable modern literacy that is likely to serve you well.

Learning to program is not dissimilar to learning a new spoken/written language–first, you need to understand basic rules like grammar and syntax, then you need exemplar buildings blocks like adjectives, nouns, and prepositions, and only then can you use these ideas together to create computer programs. What this means is that you **must** dedicate enough time to practicing the basics in order to allow yourself to progressively move to more and more complex programming practice.

Taking this course means committing—for 11 weeks—to attending lectures, tutorials, and office hours, turning in assignments, practicing your programming skills, and most importantly, persevering when things get difficult. Asking questions throughout the class is not a sign of weakness. It shows that you are actively trying to understand what you know and what you do not know. We have an excellent staff of teaching assistants and peer mentors who are here to answer your questions, help you understand course material in different ways, and push you to your fullest learning potential. With your consistent and _active_ participation in learning, you can navigate the material in the course and become a proficient programmer by the end of the quarter.

* * *

# Course Format

Our class will be _partially flipped_. While some of our reserved class periods will be used for **interactive lectures** where new concepts will be introduced, other days will be reserved for in-depth **tutorials** where students will be expected to review course materials (recorded lecture videos, slides, and notes) **before** the class period and during class we will work in small groups to complete an in-depth programming assignment.

The rough schedule of the course will be (there are some exceptions):

* Mondays - Lecture Day
* Wednesdays - Tutorial Day
* Fridays - Practice+ Day

For lecture days, we'll have interactive lectures where we introduce a new topic and focus on building a core understanding. For Tutorial days, you'll work in your tutorial groups to complete an assignment during class time. On Practice+ days, we'll do a little more practice along with previewing the next components of the course.

When we assign a pre-recorded lecture, students *must* watch the video before coming to lecture. Organizationally, some topics/modules span multiple lectures.

## Office Hours
Office hours are a crucial component of this course. Everyone on our course staff is here to help you to be successful in the course and find your own power as current and future programmers. That said, it's up to you to take the initiative and cultivate a weekly / bi-weekly practice of going to office hours that works for you and your schedule. This looks different for everyone: some people go to 1-2 office hours sessions per week and finish their homework with a TA or peer mentor nearby (if needed). Other students never go to office hours (though this is rare, as the exercises are challenging). Also, different people connect with different TAs/peer mentors, so do shop around to find a person with whom you work well.

Office hours are meant to be a time where you can ask questions that you need answered. That being said, we ask that you come to office hours *having already thought about* the assignment or issue you have been having. Please try your best to come to office hours prepared to ask questions like:

* I didn't understand X idea in lecture / tutorial this week. Can you explain it to me?
* I'm having trouble finding a good place to start in this week's homework. Can you help?
* My laptop won't run this code from class. What am I doing wrong?
* My program is returning this error which I've tried to fix. What am I missing?
* What courses should I take next after CS 111?
* What kinds of CS-related careers and opportunities are out there?

* * *

# Course Staff

This is a very large class and in order to better support each of your learning goals, we have 33 course staff members.

## Instructor

* Prof. Connor Bain (connor.bain@northwestern.edu)

## Peer Mentors

Our Peer Mentors (PMs) serve as your first point of contact in the course. PMs will be assigned to tutorial groups so that you can build a relationship with them over the course of the quarter. They will also host office hours each week that will be open for all students. That means that there will be more than 60 office hours offered per week for our course. Please note that you are welcome to attend any office hours that work for your schedule and you're not limited to your assigned PM's hours.


## Graduate Teaching Assistants

You can think of our Graduate Teaching Assistants as "Super PMs!" Not only can they serve as meaningful course resources, but they can also provide broader context to our pedagogical approach, talk more about research opportunities in the field of Computer Science, and address concerns you may not feel comfortable with talking to a peer about. In general, if you'd like to reach out to one our TAs, please also CC Prof. Bain (connor.bain@northwestern.edu) as they're very busy people and we work as a team!

# Course Grading Policy

Your course grade will consist of 4 weighted components: Tutorials, Exercises, Mini-Quizzes, and Quizzes. The weights of each component are below:

{:.medium}
|--- |--- |
| **8 Tutorials** (of 9) | 15% |
| **8 Exercises** (of 9) | 40% |
| **Mini Quizzes** (1 per module) | 5% |
| **3 Quizzes** (of 4) | 40% |

Your final grade will be the weighted average of all the above assignments. Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale which is set by the registrar's office and shown below. Final course grades **are not rounded or curved**:

{:.medium}
|--- |--- |
| A  | 93 - 100   |
| A- | 90 - 92.99 |
| B+ | 87 - 89.99 |
| B  | 84 - 86.99 |
| B- | 80 - 83.99 |
| C  | 70 - 79.99 |
| D* | 60 - 69.99 |
| F  | 0  - 59.99 |

> **Note**: The Graduate School does not recognize D letter grades meaning if you are enrolled in the class as a graduate student, the range for the F grade is 0-69.99.

## Tutorials
The idea of the Tutorials is to provide you with opportunities to both practice your own programming skill *as well as learn to communicate with and help other programmers*. As such, these Tutorials will be held on Wednesdays (with one exception) during our scheduled class time during the quarter.

These will start the second week of class and you will sign up for a particular Tutorial group at the end of Week 1.

By completing the tutorials, you will become familiar with the types of strategies you might use to approach problems , push you to write lots of programs, and help you assess what you know and don't know so that you can know when to ask for more help in lecture or in office hours.

This course is meant to a be a learning community which requires the dedicated participation of all members. Attendance is required for the first Tutorial, but you may choose to submit future tutorials remotely.

If you attend the Tutorial session in-person and make a legitimate attempt (up to the discretion of your Peer Mentor) at completing the assignment, you will receive full-credit. If you choose not to attend in-person, then your assignment will be reviewed for completion _and accuracy_ meaning you may nor may not receive full credit. Remote tutorials will be graded via the same autograding mechanism as the Exercises.

If you attended class but for some reason were marked absent, [you can fill out this Attendance Petition Form](https://forms.gle/F5tM4W6kpPbfJ9kE7).

We will not accept late tutorial submissions.

## Exercises

The Exercises serve as larger programming assignments that build upon the content we discuss in lecture and work on in Tutorials. The 10 weekly Exercises will be spread across our 11 weeks of class and will be submitted on Canvas and generally due on Mondays before the start of class.

It is up to you to verify that:
1. You have submitted the correct file.
2. That your program runs without intervention (except those assignments that ask for human input).
3. That your program is NOT dependent on running on _your specific_ computer.

These exercises will be graded via an autograder (computerized grading machine) as well as checked for plagiarism against other students' (including from past quarters) solutions, online solutions, and a large database of course content.

You may submit the assignments up to 48 hours late with a 10% penalty per 24-hours.

### Petition to Resubmit (edit 10/5/22)

If you score below an 80 **because of an issue with the autograder**, you may petition to resubmit **exactly one Exercise per quarter**. You need to first fill out the [Petition to Resubmit Google Form](https://forms.gle/E4v4jjpvYZstiWQz7) and then resubmit the assignment via Canvas **before 1pm the following day that grades are posted**. Any resubmissions through this process will be treated as if they were submitted 48-hours late. Please also remember that our Emergency Grade Erasure policy also lessens the impact of single assignments on your grade. Note that because of the quick turnaround at the end of the quarter, neither the Extra Credit Exercise nor Exercise 8 are eligible for resubmissions.

In order to petition to resubmit, you must:
* **Have already received your grade on the assignment**.
* Not have had access to the solutions for the assignment.
* Attest to not having looked at any other student's work or spoken with other students about the solutions since submitting your assignment.
* Must have a valid reasoning as to why _specifically the fact your assignment is autograded_ led to the fact your score lowered. Possibilities include:
  * Incorrect naming of variables
  * Incorrect typing of expressions
  * Syntax errors from typos
  * _Up to the discretion of the instructor_: incorrect file upload

The following are NOT valid reasons for resubmission:
  * Did not write your own tests
  * Did not consider cases specifically called out in Lectures / Pre-recorded Lectures / Assignment descriptions
  * Did not follow the directions of the assignment

All of the above reasonings may be subject to further scrutiny.

## Mini-quizzes

These will be short quizzes for each module of the course that serve as a check of your attendance and/or asynchronous participation in the course. For those that complete the Mini-Quiz in class, you will receive full credit for your attendance and full participation. If you choose to complete the Mini-Quiz remotely, you will need to complete the Canvas version of the quiz within 48 hours of your scheduled class time.

If you attended class but for some reason were marked absent, [you can fill out this Attendance Petition Form](https://forms.gle/F5tM4W6kpPbfJ9kE7).

## Quizzes

There will be four cumulative assessments of your knowledge and practice of the course material administered in-person during our assigned class time (50 minutes). The tentative schedule for these quizzes is below:

{:.medium}
| Quiz | Focus Topic  | Date |
| ---  | ------ | ---- |
| Q1   | Fundamentals | October 17  |
| Q2   | Recursion    | November 2  |
| Q3   | Imperatives  | November 21 |
| Q4   | Summative    | Section 1. December 9, 9am<br>Section 2. December 8, 9am

Please note that the Emergency Erasure Policy (more info below) might affect how these 4 quizzes affect your grade.

## Grading Equity Policies

> The course is specifically designed to be academically equitable to all students when it comes to assessment and has two special policies related to grading: 1. An _emergency erasure policy_; 2. A _deliberate extension policy_.

These two policies are provided to accommodate the myriad situations that students encounter over the life cycle of the class (e.g. student org travel, sickness, etc.). **This built-in leniency means that there will be no other exceptions to the course syllabus without prior authorization from the Dean of Students at Northwestern. I cannot offer any other leniency, make-up assignments, extensions, etc., outside these policies.**

### Deliberate Extension Policy

The _deliberate extension policy_ applies ONLY to **Exercises** and is meant to accommodate students who may have a particular week during the quarter where they are unable to complete the assigned Exercise on-time. Students may apply (using a Google Form included at the bottom of each assignment) for a 48-hour no-penalty no-questions-asked extension given the two below requirements are satisfied:

* Students **must** request the extension via the form at least 24 hours in advance of the Exercise deadline.
* Students **may not** request extensions on consecutive assignments.

The policy is _deliberate_ in that you, as a student, must actively consider at least 24 hours in advance of the deadline that you will need extra time to complete this assignment. We do not allow consecutive extensions. If you find yourself needing extra time on consecutive assignments, this is a good sign that you need to reach out to someone on the Course Staff for help.

There will be no exceptions to this policy. Once you are granted an extension, it cannot be voided.

### Emergency Grade Erasure Policy

The _emergency grade erasure policy_ acknowledges that often times life situations occur that make it impossible to keep up in a course. **_Do not_ use this a planning or scheduling device.** This is specifically meant to take care of emergencies that happen in your life during the quarter.

* Your lowest quiz score (including 0s) is dropped (best 3 of 4)
* Your lowest tutorial score (including 0s) is dropped (best 8 of 9)
  * _You may not drop the final tutorial score_ (Tutorial 8)
* Your lowest exercise score (including 0s) is dropped (best 8 of 9)
  * _You may not drop the final exercise score_ (Exercise 8)

If you _choose_ to drop an assignment early in the quarter only to find yourself in an emergency situation later in the quarter, you will need to reach out to your Dean of Students in order to arrange for flexibility across all of your coursework.

This policy will be automatically applied at the end of the quarter for all students. No action is required on your part.

* * *

# Course Materials and Resources
This is a **zero cost course** meaning that you are not required to purchase any additional materials to complete the course outside those required by the university as a whole. All required course materials will be distributed to registered members of the class directly via Canvas.

## Course Software
We will be using some free software programs and libraries in order to write, debug, and run Racket programs. Installing and configuring this software can be a huge hassle, but it is part of the process of developing your computing proficiencies. Please note, you will need a computer capable of running Racket 8.6 in order to participate in this course. Any Windows/Mac/Linux computer from the last decade should be fine, however, you may encounter difficulties using a Chromebook, iPad, or other non-standard operating system.

This course uses the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) programming language and its associated Integrated Development Environment (IDE) [DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/) as its main programming tools. Note that the Racket download includes DrRacket.

If you do not have access to appropriate computing hardware, please let the course staff know _as soon as possible_ so that we can help you make other arrangements either a computing loaner program or arranging for you to use a computer lab on campus.

## Campuswire

Campuswire is a Question-and-Answer site that allows students to ask questions that can then be answered by _either_ Course Staff or other students in the course as well as create discussion areas about both related and unrelated topics.

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> Check out our course's Canvas page for the registration link.

## Auxillary Texts

While we will not follow any textbook exactly, we will use two auxiliary texts which can serve as an excellent resource both for students looking for different perspectives on the course content as well as students looking for additional content outside our syllabus (note, both are free to access online):

* Abelson, H., Sussman, G. and Sussman J. 1996. [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
* Felleisen, M., Findler, R., Flatt, M., and Krishnamurthi, S. 2018. [How to Design Programs](http://htdp.org/2022-6-7/Book/part_prologue.html)

# Policy on Academic Honesty
In the past, there have been incidents in which students have presented work other than their own. For the programming assignments, you are allowed (encouraged, even!) to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Working "together" and presenting variants of the same file is not acceptable.

Here are some specific guidelines:

* Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form – on paper, via e-mail, or by other means.
* Do not copy solutions from any source, including the web or previous CS 111 students.
* While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen, paper, whiteboard, etc.).
* Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such content to students is prohibited by Northwestern’s academic integrity policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright policies in Northwestern’s Student Conduct Code.
* Do not attempt to claim attendance for class periods in which you did not physically stay in the classroom for the entire class period. If you are found to have incorrectly reported your physical attendance at lectures, tutorial sessions, or quizzes, you will be immediately referred to the Dean of Student's Office and you will be assigned a grade of 0 for all such instances.

Contact Prof. Bain if you have any questions about what is appropriate. Please note that all suspected incidents of violating the Academic Integrity of the course will be reported immediately to the Dean of Students.

* * *

# Academic Integrity
Students in this course are required to comply with the policies found in the booklet, "Academic Integrity at Northwestern University: A Basic Guide". All papers submitted for credit in this course must be submitted electronically unless otherwise instructed by the professor. Your written work may be tested for plagiarized content.

# COVID-19 Classroom Expectations
Students, faculty and staff must comply with University expectations regarding appropriate classroom behavior, including those outlined below and in the [COVID-19 Expectations](https://www.northwestern.edu/communitystandards/about-us/northwestern-university-student-expectations-covid-19.html) for Students. With respect to classroom procedures, this includes:

* Policies regarding masking, social distancing and other public health measures evolve as the situation changes. Students are responsible for understanding and complying with current University, state and city requirements.
* In some classes, masking and/or social distancing may be required as a result of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodation for the instructor or a student in the class even when not generally required on campus. In such cases, the instructor will notify the class.

If a student fails to comply with the [COVID-19 Expectations](https://www.northwestern.edu/communitystandards/about-us/northwestern-university-student-expectations-covid-19.html) for Students or other University expectations related to COVID-19, the instructor may ask the student to leave the class. The instructor is asked to report the incident to the Office of Community Standards for additional follow-up.

* * *

# Recording of Class Sessions

This class or portions of this class will be recorded by the instructor for educational purposes. Your instructor will communicate how members of the class can access the recordings. Portions of the course that contain images, questions or commentary/discussion by students will be edited out of any recordings that are saved beyond the current term.

If you would like to request a recording of a lecture session, you may do so [via this Google Form](https://forms.gle/BrqGHyUAxmCj6QNY8) (https://forms.gle/BrqGHyUAxmCj6QNY8)

* * *

# Prohibition of Recording of Class Sessions by Students
