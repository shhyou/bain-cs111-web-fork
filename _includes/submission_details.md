Remember, **close DrRacket before you submit** to ensure that you've saved your latest work. The Automated Type Checker (ConnorBot) will post its results of its type checks and the built-in `check-expect`s every 30 minutes. If you get an unexpected failure, it may be because you submitted the wrong file.
